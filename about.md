<p>

My name is Kreskn. I'm a programmer, gamer, and generally an all-around nerd. I currently live in the Seattle, WA area and have worked for Microsoft since 2010, although the content and opinions on this blog are completely my own. I blog about technology in general with an emphasis on programming, specifically web technologies and .NET/C#. I'm originally from Texas and went to school at the University of Texas at Austin.
