<p>

As a big fan of privacy, I choose to use a nickname rather than my real name. My alias is "Kreskn".<br>I'm a cybersecurity & technology enthusiast, SF junkie, gamer, and all-around nerd.<br>I currently live in Romania and have worked as a freelancer on various projects since 2017.<br>The content and thoughts expressed on this blog are entirely my own.<br>I write about technology in general, with a focus on security threats, particularly exploit development and evasion techniques. In conjunction to my security career, I strive to be a better human being, to assist people when I can, to rescue animals, to conquer social anxiety, and to make the world a better place.
