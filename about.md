I am a **security engineer** looking for challenging problems to solve.
My specialization is **exploit development** with strong emphasis put on developing ROP chains, **evading AV/EDR** solutions, and creating stealthy rootkits.
I draw a lot of inspiration from distributed systems, Systems Thinking, and **artificial intelligence**.

The goal I constantly pursue is to build modern and amazing products that allow you to change the world with your business.
My motto is: *Be the change you wish to see in the world*.

In private I am an enthusiast of magic tricks and photography.
